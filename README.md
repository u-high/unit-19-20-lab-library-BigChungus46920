# Unit_19-20_Lab-Library

Follow the instructions for completing the various Class files.
Create those files in your assignment repository for this assignment.  

The ultimate test to see if your code is working is to run the Library.java main method; howeer, along the way you may want to write your own tester classes for each class you write.  I will only look at the output of Library.java, but you should write as many tester classes as you need to verify each of your classes works correctly.
